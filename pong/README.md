# Pong
Pong is one of the most famous arcade games, simulating table tennis. Each player controls a paddle in the game by dragging it vertically across the screenâ€™s left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike back and forth on the ball.

## Getting Started 
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 pong
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hilo folder and click the "run" button.
